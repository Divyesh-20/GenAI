# AudiAI

**AI-Powered Video Editing & Content Generation Platform**

Built in **24 hours** during a hackathon, AudiAI won **1st place**, a **₹30,000 prize**, and judges offered internships and explored launching their own AI startup with us.

---

## 🚀 Overview

AudiAI is a modular toolset for content creators:

* **shortGen/** – Automatically extracts short highlights from long-form videos and uploads them to YouTube.
* **aivideogen/** – Generates AI-driven video snippets from text prompts, including audio, captions, and rendering.
* **aizoom/** – Applies intelligent zoom and autofocus effects to existing video content.
* **ui/** – A Next.js + Tailwind frontend that orchestrates these services with uploads, previews, and analytics.
